# CSC365 Assignment 3

- Write a program that collects at least 1000 Wikipedia pages and links from these pages to other Wikipedia pages. Collect data for similarity metrics as in Assignments 1 and 2. Treat each link as bidirectional. As a connectivity check, report the number of disjoint sets. Store persistently (possibly just in a Serialized file).
- Write a program (either GUI or web-based) that reads the graph from step 1, allows a user to select any two pages (by title) and displays graphically the shortest (weighted by distance (inverse similarity) metric) path between them, if one exists
